**OPEN TO ALL!!.**

NO need to claim this issue.

NO submission will be accepted afterÂ **1st January, 11:59 PM**.

YourÂ next **Task**Â is to design the hackathons Section of the Website TechTerra. This is a ğŸŒŸ**30**Â **points**Â task.

This page of the website TechTerra is dedicated to all the hackathons organized in IIIT Allahabad. This page contains three sections - ongoing hackathons, upcoming hackathons and past hackathons. You just design one sectionâ€¦.as the rest two sections will be same as the first.

The hackathons card of a particular hackathon should explain the major and most important things about that hackathon like time, date, theme, name, number of participants, organized by whom, etc etc.

I have attached the basic wireframe of the page in the issue .

ğŸ’¡The task needs to be done onÂ **Figma**. Figma is free to use and doesn't need to download. It is very easy to learn and hardly takes 20 minutes to learn. If you are unclear on how to use it, check the tutorial here:Â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s

## Procedure:

1. Your task is to decide on the Hackathon Section of the website. It is a different page of the website TechTerra.
2. Finally, create your ideal section on a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in theÂ **Hackathon Card Design**Â folder only.

> âœ¨PRO-TIP: Designing any piece of UI requires the following basic steps: firstly research similar websitesâ€™ footer sections (note down the key elements the placement and the arrangement) and get familiar with footer sections, secondly the wire-frame (deciding where to place which element and what all has to be placed on the page) of the home page must be done, thirdly the visual design must be given (deciding the color scheme, the font styles, weight and size, the graphics on the page) and implementing the visual design, and finally some basic touch-ups!!

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The wireframe provided is just a basic layout of the pageâ€¦you need to be creative and design the page accordingly as only good designs will be mergedâ€¦.Also as it is a **30 points** task design the page accordingly so that it looks good and attractive.

> âœ¨PRO-TIP: You must search Figma Mirror on google and then select our frame on Figma and you would be able to see how your website would look on the screen. Take references of sizes and spacing from there. Make sure you maintain consistency in your design.
