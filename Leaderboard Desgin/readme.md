YourÂ next **Task**Â is to design the Leaderboard **Section** of the Website TechTerra. This is a ðŸŒŸ**30**Â **points**Â task.

This is a new page for the website TechTerra which will display the Leaderboard. The Leaderboard should display the **number of hackathons, projects and prizes won** by the student. The Leaderboard can be sorted by- most hackathons attended, most projects submitted and most prizes won.

After making the Leaderboard sectionâ€¦.. make a section which displays the **top 5 projects** among all the projects submitted by the students on TechTerra.

 ðŸ’¡The task needs to be done onÂ **Figma**. Figma is free to use and doesn't need to download. It is very easy to learn and hardly takes 20 minutes to learn. If you are unclear on how to use it, check the tutorial here:Â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s

## Procedure:

1. Your task is to design the Leaderboard section for TechTerra.
2. Make sure that the theme/color scheme of the website that you have made and the color scheme are maintained.
3. Finally, create your ideal  section on a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in theÂ **Leaderboard design**Â folder only.

> âœ¨PRO-TIP: Designing any piece of UI requires the following basic steps: firstly research similar websitesâ€™ offer/sale sections (note down the key elements the placement and the arrangement) and get familiar with those sections, secondly the wire-frame (deciding where to place which element and what all has to be placed on the page) of the home page must be done, thirdly the visual design must be given (deciding the color scheme, the font styles, weight and size, the graphics on the page) and implementing the visual design, and finally some basic touch-ups!!

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The Leaderboard section should look decent and creative. You can always take inspiration from net and then implement it in your own way. You can go through the Leaderboard sections of various websites and then design one.  And follow the color scheme and theme of the website.

> âœ¨PRO-TIP: You must search Figma Mirror on google and then select our frame on Figma and you will be able to see how your website would look on the screen. Take references of sizes and spacing from there. Make sure you maintain consistency in your design.
