The task needs to be done on Figma. You would require knowledge of Mock-up for this task, So here is the link to an easy tutorial on mock-up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEkEvymFMw.

IMP Announcement
If a design is found to be extraordinarily great, then that merch will be declared as the official merch of Aparoksha’24. And the designer of that merch will get his/her designed merch for free as a prize.  So, make sure you participate and try designing the best merch possible as you might get your own designed merch for free! Though this is valid only if the merch is amazingly great and is selected as the official merch, But it is not necessary that out of all the submission we find the best match. So, all the decent designs will be merged and given 20 points each.

Procedure:
Firstly you must browse through and carefully research t-shirt designs on the web.
You first have to make a graphic design that appropriately describes the APK fest. Use graphics related to github, use slogans, use catchy phrases.
Now using the mockup video link given above make a mockup for a t-shirt. Remember that the design has to be implemented only on a T-Shirt and not on a hoodie or something else.
Do the task in a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in the APK T-shirt Design folder only.

✨PRO-TIP: A good use of font styles, graphics, and placement plays a crucial role in a good merch design. Use the DaFont website to get good and appropriate font styles.


MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):
Make sure that the T-shirt looks like a t-shirt, Remember that only a T-shirt has to be designed. The design must be unique and your own creativity do not copy designs from other t-shirts, though you can take references and ideas for sure. Make sure you place the Aparoksha Logo on the t-shirt. Use your creativity at its best, and for that do intensive research on the web to get amazing ideas.

✨PRO-TIP: First make the entire design that you want to impose on the t-shirt and then impose it don't try pacing each and every element when they are made. First make all the elements and then place them.
